# StashDB full-size img downloader

This plugin forces the full-size download of images from StashDB

> [!WARNING]
> This plugin adds significant lag to stash, because of the additional request and the fact that you are saving and loading an extremely high resolution file.

`tagger-img-res` is not a hard dependency, but helps immensely in trying to figure out what image is already higher resolution aside from manual devtools
